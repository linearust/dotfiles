Verify code consistency.

## Goal

Same problem solved same way — patterns uniform across codebase.

## Checks

| Check | Pass |
|-------|------|
| One pattern per problem | Similar operations use identical approach |
| Style uniform | Consistent conventions throughout |
| No mixed idioms | Pick one way, use everywhere |

## Process

1. Identify recurring patterns and inconsistencies
2. Align to canonical approach
3. Run tests if they exist

## Output

Report: `file — issue — fix`

Do not ask for confirmation. Analyze and implement directly.
